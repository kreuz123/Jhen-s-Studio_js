This is my own project(Lushretreat website).

My idea is to create a health coach studio website tailored to the needs of my friendâ€™s studio. The website primarily includes information about her services and events, along with the ability for users to book services and activities.

I implemented three JavaScript functionalities:

1.A photo browsing feature.
2.A reservation system that displays "Your booking has been saved" when all required fields are filled 
  out and the form is submitted. If any fields are left empty, it prompts "Please fill out this field."
3.A feature to fetch and display stories. Although I haven't received the stories from my friend yet, I 
  included this functionality to practice using JavaScript.
